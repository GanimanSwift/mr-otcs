Automated video playback loops and HTML schedule generation. Written in Python 3.

ffprobe is used to get video lengths. Windows users can download it from [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html).

Edit the fields in the Configuration section at the top of the script, then run in a console. Remember to use double backslashes `\\` in file paths on Windows.

The HTML template in this project is extremely basic, but it uses [Day.js](https://day.js.org) for automatic timezone conversion.
